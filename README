Friction3D

Dependencies:
pygame
pyOpenGL
PyODE

Install these dependencies in Ubuntu with the command:
sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-opengl

Download latest PyODE from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyode/

Apparently, PyODE depends on Pyrex, so install it first:
sudo apt-get install python-pyrex

Unzip downloaded package and install by executing this command in PyODE folder:
python setup.py build
python setup.py install


Friction3D should work now when you execute "friction3d.py" script.
